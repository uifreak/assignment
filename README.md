# UI Developer Assessment

In this assessment you will show your abilities and experience with regards to integrating modern technologies like React with an old codebase that uses MooTools.

Deep knowledge of MooTools is not necessary to complete this assignment but knowledge of similar libraries from the same era (like JQuery) will help.

## Assignment

The index.html page renders a very simple MooTools-based web component with 3 buttons and a div. When the buttons are clicked, they update the div's text.

### Main goal

Build a modern UI component and render it in the `id="new"` div, it should do the following:

1. Update when any of the buttons on the old component are clicked
2. Have a button of it's own that when clicked updates something in the old component (bi-directional communication)

### Requirements

- Build the component as described using React and TypeScript
- Your git commit history should show your normal work process
- The index.html should not be changed too much if possible: it is a proxy for one of the many pages in our platform.

#### Extra credits

- Show a path to modernize the old codebase, some ideas:
    - Allow modern JS syntax and/or TypeScript in the old code
    - Integrate the old codebase into a unified build system
- Unit testing

## Delivery

- For this repository and build your solution
  - Add a README-IMPLEMENTED.md with any details necessary.
- Once the solution is build, send your repository's link to your hiring contact.
- You have a week to build the solution
